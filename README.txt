## About the data/participants: 
# Data: 
The set of data includes T1 weighted images from 30 participant adults. Data was collected at a 3T Skyra scanner, in 2020
# participants:
 15 of these participants (subject numbers sub-01  -  sub-15 ) are monolinguals English speakers, 
the next 15 (sub-16  -  sub-30) are multilinguals, they all speak Romanian as a native language, 
Russian as an early L2, English as a late L3,
 and all know at least two or more additional languages (i.e., see Midrigan-Cichina et al., 2023 for a table with additional background information)

## Overview

#Project Name: 
	Multilignuals Study
	The project ran 1 year, we have collected functional data ( for a linguistic task in which participants were listening to sentences in English, Russian, and Romanian).
	We have also collected DWI and resting state MRI ( the data included in this set is only T1 weighted; we are still working on the other manuscripts). 
# Project Goal: 
	The project's objective was to understand the brain restructuring patterns and functional differences,  that are associated with high proficiency in multiple languages. 
# Methods: 
	MRI data acquisition: 
The participants were scanned with a Siemens 64-channel 3-Tesla "Skyra" MRI System, (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at the Imaging Research Center of the University of California, Davis. 
For the structural data, a T1-weighted imaging sequence was used, with an MR-RAGE (TfL) sequence with a voxel size = 0.9x0.9x0.9 mm3, FOV = 243 Ã— 243 mm, 208 sagittal slices, 7-degree flip angle, TR = 2500msec, TI = 1100 msec, and TE = 4.44 msec, Bandwith 160 Hz/Px; GRAPPA = 2, 32 reference lines.
